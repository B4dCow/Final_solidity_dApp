# Voting dApp: Particpatory Budgeting

We aim to develop a robust and user-friendly dApp for participatory budgeting, leveraging the advantages of blockchain technology to enhance transparency, security, and inclusivity in the budget allocation process.
Our dApp allows community members to propose budget allocations and vote on proposed budgets using blockchain technology

### Motivations

Traditional budgeting methods lack of transparency and inclusivity, leading to decisions that may not fully reflect the needs and priorities.
==> the role of our dApp is to empower democracies: empower citizens to engage more directly in decision-making, and that create more inclusive and responsive political systems.
Also, relying on blockchain technology ensure better security of voting.

### Method

Using Metamask and smart contract on solidity.

### Specification

Only some administrators can propose projects.
Only french voters can vote on the projects related to France.# Final_solidity_dApp
